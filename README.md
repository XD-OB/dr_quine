# dr_quine

A quine is a computer program (a kind of metaprogram) whose output and source codeare identical.

As a challenge or for fun, some programmers try to write the shortest quinein a given programming language.The operation that consist of simply opening the source file and displaying it is consid-ered cheating.

More generally, a program that uses any data entry cannot be considereda valid quine. A trivial solution is a program whose source code is empty.

Indeed, theexecution of such a program produces for most languages no output, that is to say thesource code of the program.

## Bonus
The programs are made also with:
- Python
- JavaScript
